# Breast cancer Classification

Recently, The healthcare sector is poised for a radical transformation led by artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques and is powered by an abundance of data sources including electronic medical records, claim form data, genome sequences, medical imaging, and even integrated sensor data.
The applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in the healthcare sector have continued to increase, and research in recent areas such as machine learning continues to highlight the potential of computers to predict results and improve clinical processes in a wide range of settings.
In this project, I going to use machine learning techniques to help in the early detection of breast cancer which will increase chances of treatment.

## Dataset

This is Wisconsin Dataset for breast cancer but you will find it inside the root folder of this project.

## Algorithms
I used Classification algorithms of supervised learning. There are many different classification models in machine learning: 
> *  Logistic Regression.
> *  K-Nearest Neighbor.
> *  Random Forest Classification.


### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 1.3.4
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.21.2
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 3.4.3
> *  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.24.2

## Results:
After applying the different classification models, I got the accuracies with different models below:
> *  1. Logistic Regression 0.95%
> *  2. Nearest Neighbors 0.96%
> *  3. Random Forest Classification 0.99%
> Random Forest Classification gave the best results for this dataset
